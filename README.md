# Vision system
This is a work in progress.
Main concept so far:
Determine points of high contrast in an image so that a Hough Transform may be used to find edges.
Currently, points are found and are displayed on screen.  Using edge detection, a robot can find where it is on competition boards (e.g. Botball) using an implemention of a Kalman Filter with optical tracking and nine or more degrees of freedom.
